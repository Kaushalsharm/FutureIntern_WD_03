 database.php 

<?php
$host = "localhost";
$dbname = "login_db";
$username = "root";
$password = "";
Explanation:
$host, $dbname, $username, $password: These variables store the credentials needed to connect to the MySQL database. Adjust these values according to your database configuration.
$host: Specifies the hostname where MySQL server is running. Here, it's set to localhost, which means the MySQL server is on the same machine as the web server.
$dbname: Specifies the name of the database (login_db in this case) you want to connect to.
$username: Specifies the MySQL username (root in this case) used to connect to the database server.
$password: Specifies the password for the MySQL user (root in this case). Ensure this password is secure and matches the setup of your MySQL server.
php
Copy code
$mysqli = new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname);
Explanation:
new mysqli($host, $username, $password, $dbname): This line creates a new instance of the MySQLi class, which is used to establish a connection to the MySQL database.
$host, $username, $password, $dbname: These variables are passed as parameters to the constructor of mysqli to specify the connection details.
$mysqli: This variable holds the connection object ($mysqli) that represents the connection to the MySQL database.
php
Copy code
if ($mysqli->connect_errno) {
    die("Connection error: " . $mysqli->connect_error);
}
Explanation:
if ($mysqli->connect_errno) { ... }: Checks if there was an error connecting to the MySQL database.
$mysqli->connect_errno: Returns an error number if there was an error connecting (non-zero value indicates an error).
$mysqli->connect_error: Provides a description of the last connection error.
die("Connection error: " . $mysqli->connect_error);: If there's a connection error, this line terminates the script (die() function halts execution) and prints the error message.
php
Copy code
return $mysqli;
Explanation:
return $mysqli;: This line returns the $mysqli object from the script. It allows other PHP scripts that include or require database.php to use this $mysqli object for performing database operations like querying, inserting, updating, etc.
The returned $mysqli object represents the active connection to the MySQL database specified by the $host, $username, $password, and $dbname variables.
Summary:
This database.php script sets up a MySQL database connection using MySQLi, checks for any connection errors, and returns the database connection object ($mysqli). It's a foundational script that other PHP scripts can include to interact with the MySQL database specified by the connection parameters ($host, $dbname, $username, $password).

Certainly! Let's go through the PHP script and HTML markup line by line:

PHP Section
php
Copy code
<?php
session_start();
Explanation:
session_start();: This function initializes a new session or resumes an existing session. It must be called before any output is sent to the browser.
php
Copy code
$mysqli = require __DIR__ . "/database.php";
Explanation:
$mysqli = require __DIR__ . "/database.php";: This line includes (require) the database.php script and assigns the returned value (which is the MySQLi connection object) to the $mysqli variable. This enables database operations in this script.
php
Copy code
if (isset($_SESSION["user_id"])) {
    $sql = "SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = {$_SESSION["user_id"]}";
    $result = $mysqli->query($sql);
    $user = $result->fetch_assoc();
}
Explanation:
if (isset($_SESSION["user_id"])) { ... }: Checks if $_SESSION["user_id"] is set, which indicates that a user is logged in.
$sql = "SELECT * FROM user WHERE id = {$_SESSION["user_id"]}";: Constructs an SQL query to fetch user data from the user table based on the user_id stored in the session.
$result = $mysqli->query($sql);: Executes the SQL query using the $mysqli connection object and stores the result set in $result.
$user = $result->fetch_assoc();: Fetches the first row of the result set as an associative array ($user), which contains user information.
HTML Section
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Home</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/water.css@2/out/water.css">
</head>
<body>
Explanation:
Basic HTML structure defining the document type (<!DOCTYPE html>), opening <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Sets the page title (<title>Home</title>), character set (<meta charset="UTF-8">), and includes a CSS stylesheet (<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/water.css@2/out/water.css">).
html
Copy code
    <h1>Home</h1>
Explanation:
Displays a level 1 heading (<h1>Home</h1>), indicating this is the homepage.
php
Copy code
    <?php if (isset($user)): ?>
        
        <p>Hello <?= htmlspecialchars($user["name"]) ?></p>
        
        <p><a href="logout.php">Log out</a></p>
        
    <?php else: ?>
        
        <p><a href="login.php">Log in</a> or <a href="signup.php">sign up</a></p>
        
    <?php endif; ?>
Explanation:
Uses PHP conditional (<?php if (isset($user)): ?> ... <?php else: ?> ... <?php endif; ?>) to check if $user is set (i.e., if a user is logged in).
If $user is set (user is logged in):
Displays a greeting message using htmlspecialchars() to sanitize and display the user's name (<p>Hello <?= htmlspecialchars($user["name"]) ?></p>).
Provides a logout link (<p><a href="logout.php">Log out</a></p>).
If $user is not set (user is not logged in):
Displays login and signup links (<p><a href="login.php">Log in</a> or <a href="signup.php">sign up</a></p>).
html
Copy code
</body>
</html>
Explanation:
Closes the <body> and <html> tags, ending the HTML document.
Summary:
This PHP script (index.php) and HTML markup together create a basic homepage that:

Checks if a user is logged in ($_SESSION["user_id"]).
Displays a personalized greeting and logout link if a user is logged in.
Provides links to login or sign up if no user is logged in.
Includes basic HTML structure and styling for presentation.
This setup forms a simple but effective user authentication and navigation system for a website, handling user sessions and presenting content based on login status.
